The Inventory Management System is a Java-based, menu-driven console application developed to illustrate the basic concepts of object-oriented programming and file handling. The system provides functionality to add, view, and search products based on a unique product ID, determine the total value of the inventory, and persist the inventory data using file handling operations. Buffered file handling operations are implemented to support efficient reading and writing of product data, and error-free handling of exceptions is also implemented. The project is developed with a modular class design and meets academic requirements for applying basic Java concepts to an inventory management problem.
